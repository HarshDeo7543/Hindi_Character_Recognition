#**Hindi Character Recognition Project**

This repository contains a deep learning-based solution for Hindi character recognition using TensorFlow and Keras. The project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of Hindi characters into their respective categories. The dataset is preprocessed using data augmentation techniques to improve model performance.

#**Features**
Deep Learning Model: Built with TensorFlow/Keras using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).
Data Augmentation: Includes rescaling, shearing, zooming, and horizontal flipping for better generalization.
Visualization: Plots for training/validation accuracy and loss trends, and a confusion matrix for evaluation.
Random Prediction: Functionality to predict and visualize results for random images from the test dataset.
Project Structure
Hindi_Character_Recognition.py: Main Python script containing the code for training and evaluation.
Training Data/: Directory containing the training dataset (not included in this repository, see dataset details below).
Testing Data/: Directory containing the testing dataset (not included in this repository, see dataset details below).
